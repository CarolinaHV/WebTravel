                    <h2 id="HISTORY" style="color:dimgray; text-align:center"> HISTORY</h2>
                    <p> The city of London, founded by the Romans under the name of Londinium in the year 43, is located in the south of England and is the political and economic capital of the United Kingdom. The city center is located 60 km from the mouth of the Tamesis, the river that runs through the city. Its privileged location in the center of south west England benefited it and, for a long time, it was the most populous and wealthy region in the country.</p>
                    <p>The city does not appear until after the Roman conquest. Roman rule extended from the 1st century AD. until the 5th century, when the Empire fell. In the 3rd century, Londinium, with its port, was an important nucleus of population, with some 50,000 inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Ruined by the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the 5th century, in the 7th century it became the capital of the small Essex kingdom and was the episcopal see.</p>
                    <p>Although it suffered from Scandinavian incursions in the 9th century, the establishment of Danish settlers in the neighborhood encouraged entrepreneurship and a desire for commerce, making it the first urban center in the country.  Its wealth attracted the Scandinavian and Danish kings who besieged the city and forced it to pay tribute.</p>
                    <p>From 1067 the city had the same rights as a county and only depended on the royal authority. The Tower of London dates from this time.</p>
                    <p>In 1191 the city was constituted as a municipality (corporation) by replacing a mayor with the prime minister (portreeve). In 1215, London had the privilege of electing its mayor every year.</p>
                    <p>For a long time, England lacked fixed capital. From the thirteenth century, Westminster, a place near London, became one of the main seats of the Government. Furthermore, the rise of European trade was another stimulant to make London the capital of the kingdom.</p>
                    <h4>An expanding city</h4>
                    <p>During the XIV century the port of London became a center for the distribution of goods. This activity was reinforced in the 15th century by a powerful textile industry.  From the 16th century to the mid-18th century, London benefited from the political centralization and expansion of maritime trade developed by the Tudors and continued by the Stuarts. During the reign of Enrique VIII the city had about 100,000 inhabitants. In the mid-seventeenth century they numbered 500,000.</p>
                    <p>In 1665, although the great urban planning plans had already begun, most of the city was enclosed within the old wall, which led to a serious plague epidemic that caused 70,000 victims. The following year, a gigantic fire destroyed four fifths of the city. The reconstruction of the city, the base of the area known today as the City, took into account urban needs, and the masterpieces of the architect Wren embellished the new London. The city became the center of English social life, with its palaces and its halls, its theaters, its cultural societies (Royal Society, 1662) and its museums (British Museum, 1753).</p>
                    <p>London's growth was fueled by the founding, in 1694, of the Bank of England.</p>
                    <p>Much of modern London belongs to the Victorian era. Until the beginning of the 19th century, the capital was reduced to the limits of the original Roman city, plus Westminster and Mayfair, surrounded by fields. Industrialization attracted an increasing number of people who filled these green spaces. This rapid expansion caused serious problems such as the cholera epidemic of 1832, or the "great pestilence" in 1858, caused by the stench of the Thames that forced the parliamentary sessions to be suspended.</p>
                    <p>Since 1750 the population went from 700,000 inhabitants to more than 4,500,000 in 1901 (6,600,000 with the suburban area). By the end of the 19th century, London had become the capital of international finance and trade.</p>
                    <p>The administrative needs of a center of so much commercial activity prompted the creation in 1888 of a new autonomous territorial unit, the county of London, governed by the "London county council". This county was divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive expansion soon spilled out of the county limits as a very rapidly developing suburban area was formed. After a stationary period, the population of the capital began to decrease at the end of the First World War and fell below 3,500,000 by 1950. In return, the suburban area has grown steadily.</p>
                    <p>In 1963 a new division of the London agglomeration was carried out, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs.</p>

The construction of Big Ben began in 1843, after the great fire in London on October 16, 1834, which seriously affected the Palace of Westminster.

                    <h3>City Hall</h3>
                        <p>The City Hall is one of the newest and most modern buildings in London where the offices of the City Council and the City Assemblies are housed. It is located south of the Thames, very close to the Tower Bridge in London.</p>
                        <p>It is a modern building designed by the well-known architect Norman Foster, the same architect who designed the London Millennium Bridge and who remodeled the iconic Reichstag (German Parliament in Berlin).</p>
                        <p>The building is about 45 meters high, in which a total of 10 floors are distributed and through which a long spiral staircase of 500 meters in length runs. At the top is an exhibition and meeting room called London's Living Room, with an open gazebo that is sometimes open to the public.</p>
                        <p>Its modernity is not only applied to its peculiar and futuristic design. This glass and steel building replaces air conditioning with natural ventilation and is precisely inclined to avoid direct sunlight during the most intense hours, so air conditioning is not necessary.  It also has a series of solar panels to supply the electrical consumption of the entire building.</p>
                    <h3>Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese</h3>
                        <p>There are many pubs in London that claim that Charles Dickens had a drink there or just frequented them, however, reading the Tale of Two Cities only names one: Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese.</p>
                        <p>This dark pub is perfectly Dickesian and its ground floor is reminiscent of a cavern or a dungeon, it is not by chance that it dates from 1538. It is also said that Tennyson, Stevenson and Conan Doyle frequently passed by its bar. Despite having more than half a century, this pub is frequented for after office or just to drink a pint on the weekend.</p>

                        <p> The Sherlock Holmes pub is a traditional English pub serving pints and pub food.</p>
                        <p>As well as a bar and restaurant, the pub has a secret - a complete recreation of Holmes and Watson's study and sitting room with a large collection of objects and photographs related to the characters from the books and adaptations.</p>
                        <p>The collection was put together for the Festival of Great Britain and moved to this permanent home at the Sherlock Holmes pub in 1957.</p>

                        <p>Of all the riverside pubs, this one is the most special. Really really old, really really near the river, really really good. Soak up the atmosphere in a dark, wooden alcove or arrive early for a space on the decked terrace – you’ll have the Thames lapping underneath you when the tide comes in.</p>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/about-twinings/flagship-store-london-216-strand" target="_blank">Twinings On The Strand</a></h3>
                        <p>To speak of Twinings is to speak of an icon when it comes to tea. And although you can buy a package of the brand in any supermarket, we encourage you to have a much more genuine experience having a tea in the original Twinings lounge on Strand Street, an authentic place that is considered part of the British Heritage and that it has nothing more and nothing less than ... 300 years of history!</p>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.andystaverna.co.uk/" target="_blank">Andy's Taverna</a></h3>
                        <p>Andy’s Taverna restaurant in a corner of London that could be reasonably nicknamed Little Greek Cyprus is a charming, casual dining spot with all the cheer of the Greek islands. The white-fronted restaurant has classic blue awnings, while a subtler blue and white theme continues indoors to remind you of whitewashed Greek houses and the blue Aegean. </p>
                        <p>This long-established restaurant is famous for its warm staff, pocket-friendly prices and generous portions. Sea bass and sea bream are flown in daily from Greece. The menu includes your favourite Greek breads and dips to start, main courses of grilled Aegean sea bass with potatoes and salad, and selections of classic Greek pastries for dessert.</p>

                        <p>Regulars at this well-established south London institution are greeted by name and invited to eat at the bar. Mellow lighting and soft wood tones lend a sense of convivial familiarity to the raised dining area beyond, where families, friends and dates blend comfortably together. Bar 61’s tapas menu features plenty of vegetarian options alongside standards such as chorizo and calamares. </p>
                        <p>We particularly liked the abundance of chunky vegetables in deftly seasoned ratatouille, and found the meat on our pork cutlets almost tender enough to cut itself. Everything we sampled was a fine match for the bold Bordón crianza that staff recommended from an extensive list of Spanish wines.</p>
