    <h2 id="HISTORY" style="color:dimgray; text-align:center">NETHERLANDS HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The official name of the country is Kingdom of the Netherlands. King William Alexander is the king of the nation. Actually, "Holland" only refers to the two provinces of South Holland and North Holland. However, the name Holland is often used to refer to all of the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Entre 1588 y 1795, el área que ocupan actualmente los Países Bajos era la República de los Siete Países Bajos Unidos. En 1795, la república fue conquistada por tropas francesas y se convirtió en la República Bátava. En 1806, Napoleón nombró rey a su hermano Luís, convirtiendo el país en un reino. Los Países Bajos siguieron siendo un reino después de la derrota de Napoleón. En ese momento, la zona denominada “Holanda” fue la que más contribuyó a la economía y la riqueza de toda la nación. Por este motivo, se empezó a utilizar su nombre para referirse a todo el país.</p>

    <h2 id="PLACES" style="color:seagreen; text-align:center">TOURIST SITES</h2>
    <h3>Museumplein</h3>
        <p>There’s more culture on this one square in the Museumkwartier than you’ll find in most other whole cities.</p>
        <p>The Museumplein is in Amsterdam’s well-heeled Oud-Zuid district, noted for its plush properties, upmarket boutiques (Hoofstraat and Van Baerlestraat) and the city’s favourite park at Vondelpark.</p>
        <p>So needless to say, we’ll keep coming back to this part of the capital on this list.</p>
        <p>But your main goal has to be the grassy square and its cluster of world-beating museums.</p>
        <p>The big ones all follow below, counting the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum and the Stedelijk Museum, as well as the Concertgebouw, one of the world’s best places to watch a classical concert.</p>
        <p>The area took shape in the 1880s after the construction of the Rijksmuseum, and the square was re-landscaped in 1999. There are outdoor events and celebrations on the square all year, including a skating rink from November to February.</p>
    <h3>Van Gogh Museum</h3>
        <p>Opened in 1973, the Van Gogh Museum has the largest collection of works by Vincent Van Gogh in the world.</p>
        <p>This includes 200 paintings, 500+ drawings and 750 letters, as well as pieces by contemporaries and influences like Rodin, Monet, Signac, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet and Gauguin.</p>
        <P>Van Gogh’s work is hung chronologically, presenting five different periods: Nuenen/Antwerp (1880-86), Paris (1886-88), Arles (1888-1889), Saint-Rémy (1889-90) and Auvers-sur-Oise (1890). There’s much to savour, but Sunflowers, Almond Blossoms, Bedroom in Arles and Wheatfield with Crows are indispensible.</P>
        <p>With more than 2.1 million visitors a year, the Van Gogh Museum is the most popular museum in the Netherlands.</p>
    <h3>Rijksmuseum</h3>
        <p>An extraordinary showcase for Dutch art, applied art and historical artefacts, the Rijksmuseum beckons you through 800 years of Dutch history at a purpose-built neo-Gothic palace.</p>
        <p>Some 8,000 pieces are on show at any one time, and for many people the museum’s pinnacle is the collection of Dutch Golden Age paintings.</p>
        <p>There are masterpieces like The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer, The Night Watch by Rembrandt and Portrait of a Young Couple by Frans Hals.</p>
        <p>You can embark on adventure through Dutch culture and design, via Delftware, textiles, glass, armour, costume, sculpture and stunning 17th-century dollhouses.</p>
        <p>Two exhibits that give a sense of the Dutch Golden Age are the Hartog Plate, the oldest known artefact of European exploration in Australia, and the stern of the HMS Royal Charles, captured in the Raid on the Medway in 1667.</p>
    <h3>Anne Frank House</h3>    
        <p>TOn the Prinsengracht, the Anne Frank House preserves the secret annexe where the young diarist Anne Frank hid from Nazi persecution from 1942 until she was captured along with her family and four other inhabitants in 1944. The rooms are on an enclosed courtyard behind a 17th-century canal house that served as the Dutch HQs of the spice and gelling companies Frank’s father Otto worked for.</p>
        <p>Otto was the Frank family’s sole survivor after the Holocaust, and published his daughter’s diary in 1947. You’ll see the original copy of this defining work, as well as photographs and items belonging to the Frank family and the four other inhabitants of the annexe.</p>
        <P>The secret rooms give a visceral sense of what it was like to live in hiding, while temporary exhibitions on persecution and fascism will inspire renewed vigilance.</p>
    <h3>Stedelijk Museum</h3>
        <p>Open since 1895, the third of that trio of cultural giants on the Museumplein is the Stedelijk Museum, dedicated to modern and contemporary art, from Vincent van Gogh onwards.</p>
        <p>All of the big art movements involving the Netherlands are represented, like Neo-Impressionism, De Stijl, Bauhaus, CoBrA and Pop art.</p>
        <p>There’s painting, sculpture, installation art, video art prints, posters, graphic design and artists books.</p>
        <p>You can feast your eyes on works by Piet Mondrian, Karel Appel, Willem de Kooning, Kandinsky, Cézanne, Chagall, Matisse, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Gilbert & George, to name a small few.</p>
        <p>The late-19th-century main building was given a modern extension in 2012, nicknamed “the bathtub”, serving as the main entrance and making a big statement on the Museumplein.</p>
    <h3>Vondelpark</h3>
        <p>Amsterdam’s park of choice is a tranquil strip of ponds, undulating lawns and mature trees pushing west from the Museumplein.</p>
        <p>A fun piece of trivia about the park, landscaped in 1865, is that it is constantly sinking, and needs to be renovated every generation to avoid it being completely inundated with water.</p>
        <p>The Openluchttheater puts on a vibrant schedule of free live music, musical theatre and cabaret from June to August.</p>
        <p>Although the performances cost nothing to watch, it may be worth booking online to reserve a place.</p>
        <p>The rose garden in the centre of the Vondelpark was planted in 1936 and grows more than 70 types of rose, while the park has a sculpture, The Fish (1965) by Pablo Picasso.</p>
        <p>A very respectable way to spend an hour or so is at the neo-Renaissance Vondelparkpaviljoen, built in 1874. There’s a cafe, Vertigo, in the basement, with seating on the terrace outside.</p>
    <h3>Herengracht</h3>
        <p>Patrician’s Canal in English, the Herengracht is the first of the four main canals in the city centre’s Canal Belt.</p>
        <p>This waterway was completed along with its neighbours in the 17th century as part of an expansion project that is now UNESCO listed.</p>
        <p>As the name may tell you, the Herengracht was where Amsterdam’s social elite built their grand gabled houses, and that sense of prestige has continued into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Take your time as there’s much to see, and almost every building is a work of art.</p>
        <p>You’ll pass the former office of the Dutch West India Company at Herenmarkt and one of Amsterdam’s oldest residences (built in 1590) at 81. The magnificent Bartolotti house (1617) at 172, considered the finest of all of Amsterdam’s Golden Age merchant’s houses, while the Classical terrace of the Cromhouthuizen merits a photo at 364-70. The most desirable location for a self-respecting regent or mayor was the Gouden Bocht (Golden Bend) after Leidsegracht, developed after 1663 and now home to banks and insurance companies.</p>
    <h3>Museum Het Rembrandthuis</h3>
        <p>Amazingly, the house at Jodenbreestraat 4 where Rembrandt lived and worked from 1639 to 1658 has been kept as a museum to one of the masters of the Dutch Golden Age.</p>
        <p>The house first went up in 1606 and was rebuilt around 1627. Come the early 20th century the building was in bad condition, but was restored by the eminent architect Karel de Bazel and opened as a museum in 1911. A new extension was built next door in the 90s, and this houses a huge collection of Rembrandt’s drawings and etchings, while the actual Rembrandt house reconstructs the artist’s living space and workshop.</p>
        <p>There’s even an exhibition of broken pots found during an archaeological dig and dated to Rembrandt’s stay.</p>
        <p>In 2010 the museum received its first painting by Rembrandt with the Tronie of an Old Man with Turban (1627-1628), followed by four panels from the series The Five Senses n 2017.</p>
    <h3>Cheese Museum</h3>
        <p>The Amsterdam Cheese Museum is not just offering another free cheese tasting. You can also relive the history of cheese making and experience the unique flavor of the best cheese of Holland.</p>
        <p>Learn more about Dutch cheese, see the most expensive cheese slicer of the world and have fun dressing up like a traditional Dutch cheese farmer.</p>    
    <h3>Jordaan District</h3>
        <p>Whether it’s your first or tenth time in Amsterdam, you have to drop by this grid of little streets and filled-in canals bordered by the Singel.</p>
        <p>Created during that great expansion in the 17th century, the Jordaan was first inhabited by Amsterdam’s working class and an international array of migrants, like Huguenots from France and Puritans from England, seeking the city’s famous religious tolerance.</p>
        <p>Up to the 20th century the Jordaan was firmly a neighbourhood for the salt of the earth, as well as the radical left, and was gentrified in the second half of the 20th century to become a treasured shopping and nightlife district.</p>
        <p>Explore the tight streets and sequestered courtyards, kick back at a snug little cafe, potter around the many specialty shops and galleries and visit the Noordermarkt for its organic farmers’ market on Saturdays.</p>
    <h3>Heineken Experience</h3>
        <p>After Heineken moved home to a modern facility on Amsterdam’s fringes in 1988 the monolithic 19th-century brewery building in the De Pijp district reopened as a museum to one of the world’s favourite pilsners.</p>
        <p>Over four floors, this has evolved into the Heineken Experience, which will tell you all about the brand’s origins, when a student of Louis Pasteur worked with Gerard Adriaan Heineken in 1873 to develop a special yeast.</p>
        <p>There are brewing artefacts like vast copper vessels still in situ, as well as multimedia exhibits, a bizarre 4D ride when you’ll find out what it’s like to be brewed and bottled, and, naturally, a tasting bar.</p>
    <h3>Tropenmuseum</h3>
        <p>A nuanced and thoughtfully presented ethnographic museum, the Tropenmuseum is tour through the various cultures of the world.</p>
        <p>The museum started life as a platform for the Netherlands’ colonial territories, but after Indonesia gained independence the scope switched to developing regions in general.</p>
        <p>These include Latin America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and North Africa, all with an emphasis on tolerance and care for the environment.</p>
        <p>There’s a mine of intriguing objects, photographs, sketches and footage helping to find global common ground in aspects of life like celebration, conflict, mourning and prayer.</p>
        <p>The building is a treasure too, dating to 1926 and featuring the Lichthal (Light Hall), a massive central space with a grand stairway, all overlooked by galleries.</p>
    <h3>Zaanse Schans Windmills</h3>
        <p>The Zaanse Schans is a residential area in which the 18th and 19th centuries are brought to life. Stroll past the bakery museum and enjoy the smell of fresh cookies, or take a look at the warehouse where clogs are made. You should be sure not to miss the cheese factory, pewter foundry and the various windmills. The Zaanse Schans is a unique part of the Netherlands, full of wooden houses, mills, barns and workshops. Make a cycling or sailing trip, browse the shops or treat yourself at the pancake restaurant. </p>
        <p>From a distance you can already see the sails of the windmills slowly turning, with extensive meadows in the background. It’s a serene image, but hard work is going on inside the mills. The creaking, toiling wood and all moving parts in the belly of the building make up an imposing spectacle in which wood is sawn, or oil, flour, spices and pigments are milled. Climb up to the deck of the mill via the narrow stairs, enjoy a beautiful panorama and see how the industry developed in the wider area. </p>
        <p>Since 1955, you can find the windmill De Huisman on top of the spice warehouse Indië’s Welvaren, but there was a time they were standing next to each other. Snuff mill De Huisman dates from 1786 and spice mill Indië’s Welvaren from 1908 had to make way for the expansion of Zaandam. Now the buildings make up one modern company with a centuries-old history. </p>
        <p>The delicious smell of freshly ground spices is everywhere. In the meantime three pairs of mill stones grind tropical products in a corner of the warehouse. A lot attention has been given to the interior of the authentic shop. Here you discover the world of flavours and aromas through a short movie and many informative panels, but of course also by tasting. Various spices are sold in the shop.</p>
    <h3>Keukenhof Gardens</h3>
        <p>In spring, the Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse come alive with a spectacular show of blossoms. The special theme for this year’s event is ‘Romance in Flowers’ and includes a huge rose show featuring hundreds of red roses as well as a special tulip mosaic with around 50,000 bulbs. Special activities for kids, exhibitions, events and performances will ensure the whole family finds something special to do during the flower season. The Keukenhof Gardens near Amsterdam provides visitors with a feast for the senses! With 7 million flower bulbs bloom over 32 hectares, the park is awash with the sight and scent of blossoming flowers.</p>
        <p>See the flower shows, experience this year’s theme pavilion and delight in the statues dotted around the park. Take the kids on a treasure hunt or explore the playground, petting zoo or hedge maze.</p>
        <p>Leave some time to explore the surrounding area with its fields of flowers by hiring a bike,  take a 100% electric GPS tour and join the fun by taking a boat cruise.</p>
    <h3>NEMO Science Museum</h3>
        <p>NEMO shows that learning about science and technology can be fun. Holland’s biggest science center boasts five floors that offer a range of interesting things to discover and do. Your senses will be fascinated by exhibitions, theatre shows, movies, workshops, and demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Everything at NEMO has to do with science and technology. You will smell, hear, feel and see how the world works. If you are looking for a truly stimulating and fascinating experience, NEMO has a single rule you need to follow: touch everything because only then you will discover more than the eye can see! </p>
        <p>The NEMO building is a remarkable green structure next to Amsterdam Central Station. Everyone who is curious, is welcome. NEMO's primary intended audience consists of children aged 6 to 16 but adults are welcome to learn about science and technology, too. In other words, visiting NEMO is the smart thing to do!</p>
    <h3>Albert Cuyp Markt</h3>
        <p>The Albert Cuyp Market came together at the turn of the 20th century to bring some order to the hordes of traders and hawkers who would set up shop here.</p>
        <p>Originally just a Saturday night affair, the market trades Monday to Saturday during daytime hours, with 300 stalls on both sides of the street completely shutting down traffic.</p>
        <p>You can find it all here; fresh produce, cheese, herring, spices, fabrics, cosmetics, fashion accessories, but also Surinamese, Moroccan and Antillean specialities.</p>
        <p>The high competition keeps prices low and there may not be a better place to see real Amsterdammers going about their day.</p>
    <h3>Royal Palace</h3>
        <p>This expansive building on Dam Square wasn’t always a palace, as it was built as Amsterdam’s city hall in the middle of the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Composed of yellowy sandstone shipped from Bentheim in Germany, the monument captures a city full of confidence and was believed to be the largest secular building in Europe at the time.</p>
        <p>It was Louis Napoleon who turned the building into a palace in 1806, and there are ample reminders from the city hall days.</p>
        <p>The sculpture of Atlas crowning the pediment symbolises Amsterdam’s central role in global affairs in the Golden Age.</p>
        <p>The Burgerzaal, for Amsterdam’s all-powerful burgomasters, is a sublime marble hall, laid with maps by the Blaeus and has figurative sculptures of the four elements on its arches.</p>
        <p>The Empire Style sculpture, furniture, chandeliers and bronze pendulum clocks of Louis Napoleon’s court are still in place and suffused with mythological symbolism.</p>
    <h3>Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum</h3>
        <p>Set on some 18,000 wooden piles on an artificial island in Amsterdam’s Harbour, the National Maritime Museum is in the Dutch admiralty’s former main warehouse, constructed in 1646. Even now it’s a staggering technical feat, with an inner courtyard that has been covered with an immense glass canopy.</p>
        <p>Since the Netherlands’ hegemony in the 17th century relied on maritime prowess, the museum inside is essential if you want to understand the dynamics of the Golden Age.</p>
        <p>The museum shows how the sea has shaped Dutch culture over 500 years, with displays of maps by the eminent 17th-century cartographers Willem Blaeu and son, navigational instruments, maritime paintings, models of ships, weapons and lots more.</p>
        <p>Moored beside the museum is a faithful replica of the Amsterdam, an 18th-century Dutch East India Company cargo ship wrecked in the channel in 1749 but rediscovered in 1969.</p>
    <h3>EYE Film Institute Netherlands</h3>
        <p>Impossible to miss on the other side of the IJ from the Centraal station, the EYE Film Institute Netherlands is in a bold white building designed by Delugan Meissl and unveiled in 2012. The institute came about after four film institutions, including the Dutch Film Museum, were rolled into one in 2009. You can get there via the free ferry across the IJ, a journey worth making, whether you want to check out the permanent and temporary exhibitions or catch some independent cinema (four screens), archive documentaries or classics from Tarkovsky to Rademakers.</p>
        <p>The basement has a clever exhibition on the history of cinema, with interactive quizzes to keep kids on board, while there are thought-provoking multimedia art installations throughout.</p>
        <p>The EYE’s restaurant is special, with views through floor-to-ceiling windows to the Centraal station.</p><br>

    <h2 id="RESTAURANTS" style="color: seagreen; text-align:center">RESTAURANTS</h2>
    
    <h3><a href="https://cafepollux.com/"> Cafe Pollux</a></h3>
        <p> Close to Centraal Station, Café Pollux is popular with locals and tourists alike. With Live Sports on TV, Live Music every Wednesday, a good selection of beers and late opening, it's a great bar to visit.</p>
        <p>Saturday night, it was packed with locals and tourists both. On weeknights it mostly has locals. But the vibe and energy is great. The bar tenders and owners are super friendly and nice. The beer is cheap. The music is exceptional, mainly 80s. </p>
    <h3><a href="https://upstairspannenkoeken.nl/the-menu/?lang=en">Upstairs Pannenkoekenhuis</a></h3>
        <p>The pancake house occupies a house originally built in 1539. Not only is it tiny, but the stairs leading up to the restaurant are so narrow and steep that you feel like you’re climbing a ship’s ladder. </p>
        <p>The restaurant itself opened in 1962, and the owners use traditional Dutch pancake recipes. The menu was surprisingly extensive, considering that this is known as the smallest restaurant in Europe. They have both sweet and savoury options. </p>
        <p>The restaurant only has four tables. It’s positively wee inside. There isn’t even room for chairs with backs: they have to use stools. (This probably also has the added benefit of keeping patrons from lingering too long). Anthony Bourdain ate here on an episode of The Layover.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cafesoundgarden.nl/"> Café Soundgarden</a></h3>
        <p>Don't dress up to visit this grunge bar tucked on Marnixgracht in Amsterdam's Oude West. Don't be put off by the abundant graffiti covering its gritty exterior, either.
