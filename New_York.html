        <p>As you get to the joint you run into 2 guys making pancakes nonstop, a giant liquid nutella platter, and shelves full of giant jars, cookies, and nutella sweets. Prices are around $ 5 for crepes, ice creams or coffees. And from $ 2 -4 $ for nutela cupcakes, of course!.</p>

        <p>Upper East Side preppies have gathered faithfully at J.G. Melon since 1972, but its melon kitsch décor makes this local landmark look like it opened back in 1932. Under a pressed tin-ceiling and dim yellowed lighting, ruddy-cheeked young men drink Bloody Marys next to casually attired older couples munching salads out of wooden bowls.</p>
        <p>Space is tight — the narrow, old-time bar and kitchen take up most of the front room while patrons sit elbow-to-elbow in the back — but this doesn’t dissuade couples in suits from grabbing an after-work drink, though you won’t want to impart any secrets in this jovial, noisy environment.</p>
        <p>The resolutely American menu is painted onto wooden boards and served daily from lunch until the wee-morning hours, but the only thing anyone really orders are the thick, juicy hamburgers and cheeseburgers, the house’s signature dish. Melon’s has expanded in recent years with locations in Greenwich Village and on the Upper West Side, but this original location is by far the most charming of the bunch.</p>

        <p>The title of "Best Pizza in New York" is both contentious and coveted.  Tech Insider reached out to Yelp to see what its reviewers thought about New York City pizza.  The result? Rizzo's Fine Pizza Co., with 314 total reviews and an average of 4 1/2 out of five stars, serves up the best pie.</p>
        <p>The original Rizzo's is in Astoria, Queens, but Yelp reviewers are more fond of the newest location in Manhattan's Lower East Side neighborhood.  We went to see what all the fuss is about. Scroll down for an inside look at what may just be New York's best pizza.</p>

        <p>Nestled on the 14th floor, above the Italian megastore Eataly, you find this rooftop bar and restaurant called La Birreria. As the name suggest, the setting is like a large beer garden.</p>
        <p>The terrace is a bit closed off, so while the view is nice over the close by Flatiron building and the Empire State Building, it is not the best in the city. But instead there is a great atmosphere to make up for it.</p>
        <p>There is an exiting concept with new pop-up restaurants at the rooftop every now and then, however always with an Italian base. The 2020 season will see the roof turn into Serra, an Italian countryside restaurant, available also during the colder months as Serra Alpina.</p>

    <p> Let's take a test: when you hear brunch, are the first things that come to mind are mountains of soft pancakes? For us, the blueberry pancakes from this famous bakery are the best in New York. And huge! And, if you accompany them with one of their smoothies, even better. The only ‘but’: they only accept cash.</p>  
    <p>It’s a charming little establishment, family owned and operated by a husband and wife team who put that little extra love into their food to make you remember it and want to come back.</p><br><br>

    <h2 id="ITINERARIO" style="text-align:center; color:seagreen" >ITINERARY</h2>
    <p>If you are one of those who do not want to miss a detail and make the most of your visit, if you prefer to travel on your own, we recommend that, whenever you can, buy in advance the tickets for the attractions that you will visit, because that way you will avoid queues and you'll save a lot of time. An important suggestion is that you start your tour very early, especially if you will be there for a few days, because there is a lot to see and do in New York.</p>
    <p>Tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Get a New York Explorer Pass tourist card</li>
            <li>The metro is the fastest way to travel between the attractions of the city and save time. Buy the Metro Card, a card with unlimited metro / bus trips. The 7-day one costs $ 33</li>
            <li>Climb to the Top of the Rock at sunset to finish big that first day in New York.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Midtown Manhattan</h3>
    <p>The first days are dedicated to the most iconic New York, the one you saw on your television screen a thousand and one times. We are talking about Midtown, the heart of Manhattan, where you can find emblematic places such as Times Square, Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Bryant Park, the New York Public Library, Grand Central Terminal, or skyscrapers like the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller Center (and its Top of the Rock viewpoint).</p>
    <h3>Hudson Yards, Meatpacking District, Chelsea and Broadway</h3>
    <p>The first thing you will do, after a good breakfast, is go to the new area of ​​the Hudson Yards and see The Vessel, the monument in the shape of a space basket that is driving New Yorkers crazy. Remember that you will have to request your tickets (free) in advance.</p>
    <p>The next destination is the High Line, a curious elevated park that travels through the heights of New York on the layout of an old urban train line. At the end of the High Line and after kicking its 2.4 km, you will find yourself in the Meatpacking District, once a quite depressed area and today is one of the coolest in the entire city.</p> 
    <p>through Meatpacking and you will arrive in the Chelsea neighborhood where you have a date with its famous market: the Chelsea Market. You can have a snack at their stalls and pause before continuing to Hell’s Kitchen, an area full of bars and venues.</p> 
    <p>These districts do not have specific points to visit, but it is best to walk through them and get involved with their environment and architecture. Of course, don't miss three of Kobra's best murals (Mount Rushmore, Gandhi and Mother Teresa, and We Love NY with Einstein).</p>
    <p>The last stop of the day is Broadway! What better than to celebrate your stay in the city that never sleeps with a musical? </p>
    <h3>West Village, Greenwich Village, Soho, Nolita, Little Italy and Chinatown</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most popular routes in New York: we will depart from Madison Square Park, where the curious Flatiron building is located. In addition to contemplating it (and of course, taking a photo session), we like it because right in front of it there is a square with public tables and chairs where we love to have breakfast (grab a bagel and a coffee in one of the hundreds of street carts).</p>
    <p>After gaining strength, we will start going down towards the West Village, a very cute and quite neighborhood with its typical brick houses, to then go through Soho and Nolita. Do not miss a visit to Washington Square, a square with a lot of atmosphere.</p>
    <p>The next stop will be the mythical neighborhoods of Little Italy and Chinatown, although you pass through lots of different districts, they really are next to each other and the distance will not be so close. The most interesting thing is to see how the panorama changes drastically when going from one to the other. In Chinatown the options for cheap food are almost endless, but our favorite is the Wah Fung Fast Food where for $ 4 you have super delicious bbq rice with pork.</p>
    <p> Take the opportunity to end the day with a beer at <b>Rooftop 93</b>, the terrace bar of the Wyndham Garden Chinatown hotel, with stunning views of the city. There is happy hour from 5 to 8 pm and the beer costs $ 7 (try the Brooklyn Brewery). It is the rooftop bar that we enjoy most of all those who visit.</p>
    <h3>Tour of contrasts</h3>
    <p>The Contrast Tour will give you a generic view of what New York is, beyond Manhattan. Did you know that the city is made up of 5 different neighborhoods? <b>Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.</b> With the tour of contrasts you will discover corners of the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn (the latter is a great one).</p>
    <p>At the end of the tour you will be dropped off in the northern part of Brooklyn, so you will have time to explore it thoroughly before crossing the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge and enjoying some of the best views of the city. It is also a good area to try what for some is the best hamburger in New York:<b>the Shake Shack chain.</b></p>
    <h3>Lower Manhattan + Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island</h3>
    <p>the Lower Manhattan area, focuses on the Financial District. It passes through the mythical Wall Street and its two statues (the one of the bull and the one of the girl), the New York Stock Exchange building, the Federal Hall with the statue of George Washington on its steps, the Trinity Church, the National Museum American Indian, or the pretty street of Stone Street.</p>
    <p> Also visit the World Trade Center area, where you will see some square fountains in the places where the Twin Towers were. If you want to know more about the sad event, right there is the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. And two other interesting places are the One World Observatory (the tallest building in the United States, which you can certainly climb) and the Oculus de Calatrava metro station.</p>
    <p>Take advantage of the day to go to Battery Park and take the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the island that welcomed immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, and which today takes advantage of these facilities as an interesting museum about immigration . Most tourist cards include the ferry, but if you don't have them you can buy the tickets online or do it directly at the ticket office. You can also sign up for this tour in Spanish.</p>
    <p>If you want to save some money and settle for seeing the Statue of Liberty from afar, you have the option of getting on the free ferry that goes to Staten Island.</p>
    <h3>Harlem and Central Park</h3>
    <p>This is an alternative plan to explore the Harlem neighborhood and witness a Gospel Mass, this plan is for a Sunday so also an ideal plan is to go for brunch before leaving the multicultural neighborhood and spending the afternoon in Central Park, exploring the park. New York's most famous and knowing its two star Museums: the MET and the Museum of Natural History. If visiting Harlem doesn't motivate you much, you can go to spend the morning at Coney Island</p>
